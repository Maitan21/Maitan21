# YoonSang Cho (Maitan21)
I’m Yoonsang Cho, working as a developer and a consultant in Republic of Korea.

I have done a lot of experiences in regards to development, building, and customization. I’m willing to pursue various challenges. I confidently face challenges and solve without hesitation.
I’m always looking for new, exciting experiences.👋💕

## My values
🌟 Expression as authentic self<br>
💖 Safety and trust<br>
🍏 Beginner's mindset and curiosity<br>
🙌 Shared understanding and consensus
🌱 I’m currently learning Cloud (AWS, Azure)

## How I work
My motivations are to stabilize and provide clarity through curiosity. That tends to manifest as creating (hopefully) just enough process. Checklists are my absolute favorite. ✅ If I'm too much in my head, feel free to nudge me to share what's in my brain. 😸
